    <div id="intro" class="content">
        <p>In today's society learning how to make a website is a valuable skill. For computer science majors it is a great place to showcase projects, experiences and other information about yourselves that you want the world to see. Almost every technology compnay will expect students to have some web development background, however the curriculum here at the Virginia Tech doesn't expose students to it. Web development is a great introduction to basic programming and is great for beginners to see a visual representation of the code they are writing. The following instructions will demonstrate how to build a basic personal website.
        </p>
        <p>It is very easy to start building a website. All you need is some sort of text editor such as notepad++. I personally use adobe brackets but it is completely up to you. Technology companies love web development because it has a very rapid development cycle. Once you understand the basics it can be done within minutes. </p>

    <div id="basics" class="content">
        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p>Web development is broken into three main parts, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. HTML is considered the content of the page. It is the information that you want to share with the world. CSS is the styling of the page. With CSS you can change the colors, fonts, format, and layout. JavaScript adds the functionality to the page. JavaScript is used to program the behavior of the website. This aspect of web development is closer to typical types of programming. Because of the simple design of this website this tutorial will not cover JavaScript.

        </p>
        <p>That's better, after this tutorial you will be able to make a beautiful website like this one! <a href="index.html">Click Here to back to ugly version!</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="content" id="getting_started">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>You will need to open a text editor and create two files. Save these in a folder for easy accessibility</p>
        <ul>
            <li>index.html</li>
            <li>main.css</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>index.html</b> is the main page of your website.The basic structure of a HTML file is shown below. It is constructed of tags, html, header and body. The header tags is where imports will be included. The body tag is where your content will go. </p>
        <div class="code">
            <p>&lthtml&gt</p>

            <p class="indent">&lthead&gt</p>
            <p class="indent">&lt/head&gt</p>
            <p class="indent">&ltbody&gt</p>
            <p class="indent">&lt/body&gt</p>
            <p>&lt/html&gt</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="imports" class="content">
        <h2>Imports</h2>
        <p>Imports are used in order to link your main.css file created earlier to the index.html file. There are a ton of libraries online that make it easy to use different styles buttons and icons such as Font Awesome and Bootstrap.For now we will stick to our custom made CSS files in order to style our webpage. </p>
        <p>CSS imports are placed within the header tags within index.html
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            <p>&lthead&gt</p>
            <p class="indent">&ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css"&gt</p>
            <p>&lt/head&gt</p>
        </div>
        <p>Javascript imports would be placed at the bottom of the body tags. But this wont be necessary for this tutorial</p>
        <div class="code">
            <p>&ltbody&gt</p>
            <p class="indent">&ltscript src="javascriptFile.js&gt</p>
            <p>&lt/body&gt</p>


        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="html_info" class="content">
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>As seen mentioned earlier the body tag is where your content will go. </p>
        <p> Now is a good place to discuss one of the most important parts of HTML : <b>DIVS</b></p>
        <p><b>Divs</b> define a division or a section within HTML file. They group elements together and are the foundation of any website. For example this tutorial is made up of several divs. The image at the top was in a div, and each subsequent section so far has each been their own divs. Each snippet of code on this site are inside of another div.</p>
        <div class="code">
            <p>&lthtml&gt</p>

            <p class="indent">&lthead&gt</p>
            <p class="indent">&lt/head&gt</p>
            <p class="indent">&ltbody&gt</p>
            <p class="indent-2x">&ltdiv&gt</p>
            <p class="indent-3x">&lth1&gt My Website Title&lt/h1&gt</p>
            <p class="indent-2x">&lt/div&gt</p>

            <p class="indent">&lt/body&gt</p>
            <p>&lt/html&gt</p>
        </div>
        <p>For a basic personal website we will split the site into 3 main parts (each own divs). </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Banner</li>
            <li>About</li>
            <li>Experience</li>
            <li>Contact</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The following tags are two ways to write content within these different divs. </p>
        <p><b>H Tag</b> | The header tags are used to create bold titles for your website </p>
        <div class="code">
            <h1>&lth1&gtHeader&lt/h1&gt</h1>
            <h2>&lth2&gtHeader&lt/h2&gt</h2>

            <h3>&lth3&gtHeader&lt/h3&gt</h3>

            <h4>&lth4&gtHeader&lt/h4&gt</h4>

            <h5>&lth5&gtHeader&lt/h5&gt</h5>
            <h6>&lth6&gtHeader&lt/h6&gt</h6>
        </div>
        <p><b>P Tag</b> | The paragraph tag is used to write larger amounts of text </p>
        <div class="code">
            <p>&ltp&gt</p>
