        <p>In today's society learning how to make a website is a valuable skill. For computer science majors it is a great place to showcase projects, experiences and other information about yourselves that you want the world to see. Almost every technology compnay will expect students to have some web development background, however the curriculum here at the Virginia Tech doesn't expose students to it. Web development is a great introduction to basic programming and is great for beginners to see a visual representation of the code they are writing. The following instructions will demonstrate how to build a basic personal website. </p>

        <p>It is very easy to start building a website. All you need is some sort of text editor such as notepad++. I personally use adobe brackets but it is completely up to you. Technology companies love web development because it has a very rapid development cycle. Once you understand the basics it can be done within minutes. </p>

        <h4>Basics</h4>
        <p>Web development is broken into three main parts, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. HTML is considered the content of the page. It is the information that you want to share with the world. CSS is the styling of the page. With CSS you can change the colors, fonts, format, layout. JavaScript adds the functionality to the page. JavaScript is used to program the behavior of the website. This aspect of web development is closer to typical types of programming. Because of the simple design of this website I will only touch on JavaScript briefly.
